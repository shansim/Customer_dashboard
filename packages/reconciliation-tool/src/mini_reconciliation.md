# Transaction Reconciliation Tool - Technical Assessment Documentation

## Executive Summary

I developed a comprehensive B2B fintech reconciliation tool that simulates real-world treasury and operations workflows. The application provides automated transaction comparison between internal system exports and provider statements, with advanced discrepancy detection, duplicate analysis, and detailed reporting capabilities.

## Problem Breakdown & Solution Approach

### 1. Input Processing & File Handling

**Challenge**: Handle multiple file formats with varying data structures and quality.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Multi-format Support**: CSV, Excel (.xlsx, .xls), and LibreOffice (.ods) files
- **Robust Parsing**: Utilized PapaParse library for CSV and SheetJS for spreadsheet formats
- **Data Normalization**: Implemented reference ID normalization (trim, uppercase) for consistent matching
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation with user-friendly error messages
- **Real-time Processing**: Async file upload with progress indicators

**Key Features**:
- Drag-and-drop file upload interface
- File format validation before processing
- Automatic column mapping and detection
- Memory-efficient streaming for large files

### 2. Transaction Matching Algorithm

**Challenge**: Accurately match transactions across different data sources with varying reference formats.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Reference-based Matching**: Primary matching using `transaction_reference` field
- **Normalization Strategy**: Trim whitespace, convert to uppercase for consistency
- **Efficient Lookup**: Hash map implementation for O(1) lookup performance
- **Duplicate Handling**: Track processed references to prevent double-counting

**Algorithm Flow**:
```
1. Normalize all transaction references
2. Build provider lookup map
3. Process internal transactions:
   - Find match in provider map
   - Analyze discrepancies if found
   - Mark as internal-only if no match
4. Identify provider-only transactions
5. Calculate summary statistics
```

### 3. Discrepancy Analysis Engine

**Challenge**: Detect and categorize different types of discrepancies with appropriate severity levels.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Multi-dimensional Analysis**: Amount, status, currency, and timestamp comparison
- **Severity Classification**: Perfect, Minor, and Major discrepancy levels
- **Percentage-based Thresholds**: 5% amount difference threshold for severity classification
- **Time-based Analysis**: 5-minute tolerance for timestamp differences

**Discrepancy Types Detected**:
- **Amount Discrepancies**: Absolute and percentage differences
- **Status Mismatches**: Different transaction statuses
- **Currency Mismatches**: Different currency codes
- **Timestamp Differences**: Time gaps between internal and provider records

### 4. Duplicate Detection System

**Challenge**: Identify and analyze duplicate transactions that could indicate processing errors.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Reference-based Grouping**: Group transactions by reference ID
- **Multi-source Analysis**: Detect duplicates in internal, provider, and matched datasets
- **Risk Assessment**: Categorize duplicates by count and consistency
- **Financial Impact Calculation**: Total amount analysis for duplicate groups

**Duplicate Categories**:
- **Low Risk**: 2 duplicates with consistent data
- **Medium Risk**: 3 duplicates or inconsistent data
- **High Risk**: 4+ duplicates requiring immediate review

### 5. Data Visualization & Reporting

**Challenge**: Present complex reconciliation results in an intuitive, actionable format.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Multi-level Dashboard**: Summary statistics, visual charts, and detailed tables
- **Interactive Circle Chart**: Visual representation of transaction distribution
