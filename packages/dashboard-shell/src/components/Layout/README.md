## Styling

### Theme Integration

- Consistent typography
- Standard spacing and border radius
- Professional shadows and transitions

### Responsive Design
- **Desktop (â‰¥768px)**: Full sidebar layout
- **Mobile (<768px)**: Collapsible sidebar with overlay
- **Small mobile (<480px)**: Simplified header layout

### CSS Classes
Additional CSS classes are provided in `layout.css`:
- `.custom-scrollbar` - Styled scrollbars
- `.hover-lift` - Hover animations
- `.loading-spinner` - Loading states
- Responsive utilities for mobile layouts

## Accessibility

### Keyboard Navigation
- All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Focus indicators using Niobi primary color
- Proper ARIA labels for screen readers

### Screen Reader Support
- Semantic HTML structure
- Descriptive button labels
- Proper heading hierarchy

## Testing

The components include comprehensive tests covering:
- Basic rendering functionality
- User interaction (sidebar toggle, logout)
- Responsive behavior
- Content rendering

Run tests with:
```bash
npm test -- DashboardLayout.test.tsx
```

## Integration Requirements

### Authentication Context
The Header component requires the `useAuth` hook to be available:
```tsx
const { user, logout } = useAuth();
```

### Router Integration
The Sidebar component uses React Router for navigation:
```tsx
import { useLocation, useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';
```

### Expected Routes
- `/dashboard` - Dashboard home
- `/dashboard/reconciliation` - Reconciliation tool
- `/dashboard/customers` - Customer accounts (placeholder)
- `/dashboard/reports` - Reports & analytics (placeholder)
- `/dashboard/queries` - Customer queries (placeholder)

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Role-based navigation visibility
- Customizable sidebar themes
- Breadcrumb navigation
- Notification center in header
- Advanced user profile management

### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading for navigation items
- Virtual scrolling for large menus
- Optimized re-renders with React.memo

**Requirement 3.4**: Dashboard layout with sidebar and content area
**Requirement 4.1**: Consistent Niobi brand design system
